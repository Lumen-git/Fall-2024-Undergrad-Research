Cleaning up parts 1 and 2
  - I made each individual step a bullet point to make the guide easier to follow, but maintained some of the accompanying information to help whoever is following the guides not only understand what to do, but why its done. I'm aiming to make these guides not only something to make a finished product, but informative about the system.

Part 3
  - Although I had all the code I needed to make part 3, I still had to assemble a demo scene to base the instructions off of. I made a new scene with improvements on the collision detection was well as giving the user the ability to spawn a ball rather than using the 3D cursor.
  - Step 3 instructions are a little rough, but should form a good basis to refine with the group.
