-Started planning how to teach AR & graphics

	Plan seems to be to have me write guides for the others to follow, then refine everything together.

	So far I've made parts 1 and 2, which go through setting up AR Foundation and surface detection.
	I'm keeping them in their own folder on Git rather than the weekly folders, partly to keep them all
	together in one neat place and also to keep any assets I have to include contained.
