From Unity Demos:

Basic Light Estimation

Demonstrates basic light estimation information from the camera frame. You should find values for "Ambient Intensity" and "Ambient Color" on screen. The relevant script is BasicLightEstimation.cs script.
HDR Light Estimation

This sample attempts to read HDR lighting information. You should find values for "Ambient Intensity", "Ambient Color", "Main Light Direction", "Main Light Intensity Lumens", "Main Light Color", and "Spherical Harmonics". Most devices only support a subset of these 6, so some will be listed as "Unavailable." The relevant script is HDRLightEstimation.cs script.

On iOS, this is only available when face tracking is enabled and requires a device that supports face tracking (such as an iPhone X, XS or 11). When available, a virtual arrow appears in front of the camera which indicates the estimated main light direction. The virtual light direction is also updated, so that virtual content appears to be lit from the direction of the real light source.

When using HDRLightEstimation, the sample will automatically pick the supported camera facing direction for you, for example World on Android and User on iOS, so it does not matter which facing direction you select in the ARCameraManager component.
