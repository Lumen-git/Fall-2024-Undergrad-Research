+-> GravitySensor: Use the gravity sensor to determine the direction of the gravity vector relative to a device. This is useful to control content by device orientation. This is usually derived from a hardware Accelerometer, by subtracting the effect of linear acceleration (see LinearAccelerationSensor). Values are affected by the Compensate Orientation setting.
