Followed my own guides to come up with some notes for improvement.

Notes from Sabrina:
[x] Add more pictures to illustrate the steps

Myself:
[] Show how to access more environments
[x] Show what the hierarchy and inspector are and explain what they do
[x] Add warning about potential new input popup (Also in TA notes)
[x] Define what the controls for the simulation are (Also in TA notes)
[x] Remove the step about testing trackables
[x] Show specifically where to put the plane prefab/how to import it

TAs:
[x] Better define where to find XR Simulation settings
